After cloning the repository:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

3. Build for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

4. Preview the production build locally:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn preview
   ```

If you want, I can also rewrite the **entire README** to be cleaner, more beginner-friendly, and include both ESLint and TypeScript notes in one place. Do you want me to do that?
